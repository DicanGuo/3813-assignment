## Git
### Git Layout
The git repository contains project folder and a README file. Angular app is in the project folder and the node server is in the server folder.
Default branch is main branch which is the latest convension.

### Version Control Approach
I commit when small features are achieved. Such as adding a form in html. This ensures me able to revert back to a specific version that all implemented features are functioning without any error.

When there is a complex issue occured where lots of changes are needed, a branch is created to solve the issue. Thus, the code is more clean and it allows me to trace back the changes I made at the specific time. When the issue is solved, I will merge the branch back to main since I am the only developer in this project.

## REST API
<!-- The Angular front end should communicate with the Node.js server using a REST API. Describe each route provided, parameters, return values, and what it does. -->

## Angular Architecture
<!-- Describe your Angular architecture in terms of components, services, and models. -->
